Sharing my thoughts on software engineering, testing and python.
-
My notes are filled with blog posts that I never started. 
My commitment starting 2020 is to share those ideas.

There is wealth of information out there. Sometimes I will highlight what I have learned from others. 
Other times I will share answers to questions that I couldn't find answers to in hope that someone else might benefit from my insights.

> We learn by doing. We master by teaching others.

We gain knowledge by reading, hearing others, etc. But we have not learned yet. 
*Stuart Firestein* would say ignorance follows knowledge.
We learn by practicing, and applying what we have learned to other problems and/or solutions.

But to truly master we must share with others.
